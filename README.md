# SQUARE UP :sparkling_heart::black_medium_small_square:

BLACKPINK has made their long anticipated return to the KPOP scene and have set the world on fire (by breaking all the girl group records). In celebration, I have made a simple click game.

## Getting Started :boom:

Click the big square at the top to play. Alternatively you could clone down this repo and play it locally.

### Prerequisites :open_file_folder:
You will need both `node` and `yarn` installed on your computer in order to run this app. You can find out more about `yarn` at their [official site.](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### Installation :file_folder:
Inside your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the location of the cloned repo. Install the necessary dependencies by running - 
```
npm i
```
or
```
yarn install
```
after the dependencies have been installed run
```
yarn start
```
to intialize the app. It will launch your prefered browser at `localhost:3000` that's it, now you can experience the ddu du ddu du


## How To Play :collision:

It's simple. There are 12 pictures of the beautiful BLACKPINK members: Lisa, Jisoo, Ros√©, and Jennie. Each time you click a picture your score increases. However if you click on an image you've already clicked it's game over! Click on all 12 without hitting a repeat to "win"! 

The prize is listening to "Ddu Du Ddu Du" on repeat. You're Welcome! and have been hit with that ddu du ddu du.

I had to do what I had to reado.
