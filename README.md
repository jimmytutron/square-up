# SQUARE UP :sparkling_heart::black_medium_small_square:

BLACKPINK has made their long anticipated return to the KPOP scene and have set the world on fire (by breaking all the girl group records). In celebration, I have made a simple click game.

## How To Play :collision:

It's simple. There are 12 pictures of the beautiful BLACKPINK members: Lisa, Jisoo, Ros√©, and Jennie. Each time you click a picture your score increases. However if you click on an image you've already clicked it's game over! Click on all 12 without hitting a repeat to "win"! 

The prize is listening to "Ddu Du Ddu Du" on repeat. You're Welcome! and have been hit with that ddu du ddu du.

I had to do what I had to reado.
